# Project Overview

## Technologies Used:
- Node JS
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Stripe
- GCP - K8s

### Node JS
The Node JS part is perfectly structured and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application, providing support and cohesion. I have integrated the complexity of PostgreSQL queries into the Node JS server and created an API structure to validate requests, which you can see in the file 'route_query.js'.

### Docker
Docker supports my application by creating instances to enhance performance, especially when a high number of requests are made by clients. This is made possible through the GCP - K8s system.

### Stripe
Stripe helps me manage payments, which I have automated to load tokens into the system. This part is designed as a monthly subscription.
